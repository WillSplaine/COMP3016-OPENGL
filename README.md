# COMP3016-OPENGL
## COMP3016's OpenGL coureswork
#### My 70% Project was to create a scene in OpenGL, and then to render a bonsai plant ontop of a podium that the player could walk around a view from different angles and zoom into. 
#### From there to add 2 lights 1- to act as a grow lamp and another to act as the sun/moon depending on ther day cycle. 
#### If given the opurtunity I would have liked to get the watering can to sit at the bottom of the window at all times and make it so it could be animated and play sound, aswell as adding the day/night cycle lighting however this would have taken alot more work and was very advanced.

### Run the Project
#### To run, open the Comp3016Remake.sln found in the GitHub, and run the project.

#### To move around the the use of the W,A,S,D keys will allow you to move in each direation
#### To look around, the use of the mouse allows the player to look wherever they wish
#### To zoom in or out, scrolling with the mouses scroll wheel will allow the user to zoom in and out (does have limits)

### Environment
#### This project was created using Visual Studios 2022 Community with C++

### Libraries
#### Please ensure these libraries are in the prokect in order to run the scene as intended
